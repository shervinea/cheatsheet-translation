> &#10230; **Translated blabla**

4. Commit the changes to your forked repository.

5. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) and call it `[code of language name] Topic name`. For example, a translation in Spanish of the deep learning cheatsheet will be called `[es] Deep learning`.

Submissions will have to be reviewed by a fellow native speaker before being accepted.
