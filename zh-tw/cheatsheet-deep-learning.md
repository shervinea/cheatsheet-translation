2. **Neural Networks**

&#10230;

<br>

3. **Neural networks are a class of models that are built with layers. Commonly used types of neural networks include convolutional and recurrent neural networks.**

&#10230;

<br>

4. **Architecture ― The vocabulary around neural networks architectures is described in the figure below:**

&#10230;

<br>

5. **[Input layer, hidden layer, output layer]**

&#10230;

<br>

6. **By noting i the ith layer of the network and j the jth hidden unit of the layer, we have:**

&#10230;

<br>

7. **where we note w, b, z the weight, bias and output respectively.**

&#10230;

<br>

8. **Activation function ― Activation functions are used at the end of a hidden unit to introduce non-linear complexities to the model. Here are the most common ones:**

&#10230;

<br>

9. **[Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, Leaky ReLU]**

&#10230;

<br>

10. **Cross-entropy loss ― In the context of neural networks, the cross-entropy loss L(z,y) is commonly used and is defined as follows:**

&#10230;

<br>

11. **Learning rate ― The learning rate, often noted α or sometimes η, indicates at which pace the weights get updated. This can be fixed or adaptively changed. The current most popular method is called Adam, which is a method that adapts the learning rate.**

&#10230;

<br>

12. **Backpropagation ― Backpropagation is a method to update the weights in the neural network by taking into account the actual output and the desired output. The derivative with respect to weight w is computed using chain rule and is of the following form:**

&#10230;

<br>

13. **As a result, the weight is updated as follows:**

&#10230;

<br>

14. **Updating weights ― In a neural network, weights are updated as follows:**

&#10230;

<br>

15. **Step 1: Take a batch of training data.**

&#10230;

<br>

16. **Step 2: Perform forward propagation to obtain the corresponding loss.**

&#10230;

<br>

17. **Step 3: Backpropagate the loss to get the gradients.**

&#10230;

<br>

18. **Step 4: Use the gradients to update the weights of the network.**

&#10230;

<br>

19. **Dropout ― Dropout is a technique meant at preventing overfitting the training data by dropping out units in a neural network. In practice, neurons are either dropped with probability p or kept with probability 1−p**

&#10230;

<br>

20. **Convolutional Neural Networks**

&#10230;

<br>

21. **Convolutional layer requirement ― By noting W the input volume size, F the size of the convolutional layer neurons, P the amount of zero padding, then the number of neurons N that fit in a given volume is such that:**

&#10230;

<br>

22. **Batch normalization ― It is a step of hyperparameter γ,β that normalizes the batch {xi}. By noting μB,σ2B the mean and variance of that we want to correct to the batch, it is done as follows:**

&#10230;

<br>

23. **It is usually done after a fully connected/convolutional layer and before a non-linearity layer and aims at allowing higher learning rates and reducing the strong dependence on initialization.**

&#10230;

<br>

24. **Recurrent Neural Networks**

&#10230;

<br>

25. **Types of gates ― Here are the different types of gates that we encounter in a typical recurrent neural network:**

&#10230;

<br>

26. **[Input gate, forget gate, gate, output gate]**

&#10230;

<br>

27. **[Write to cell or not?, Erase a cell or not?, How much to write to cell?, How much to reveal cell?]**

&#10230;

<br>

28. **LSTM ― A long short-term memory (LSTM) network is a type of RNN model that avoids the vanishing gradient problem by adding 'forget' gates.**

&#10230;

<br>

29. **Reinforcement Learning and Control**

&#10230;

<br>

30. **The goal of reinforcement learning is for an agent to learn how to evolve in an environment.**

&#10230;

<br>

31. **Definitions**

&#10230;

<br>

32. **Markov decision processes ― A Markov decision process (MDP) is a 5-tuple (S,A,{Psa},γ,R) where:**

&#10230;

<br>

33. **S is the set of states**

&#10230;

<br>

34. **A is the set of actions**

&#10230;

<br>

35. **{Psa} are the state transition probabilities for s∈S and a∈A**

&#10230;

<br>

36. **γ∈[0,1[ is the discount factor**

&#10230;

<br>

37. **R:S×A⟶R or R:S⟶R is the reward function that the algorithm wants to maximize**

&#10230;

<br>

38. **Policy ― A policy π is a function π:S⟶A that maps states to actions.**

&#10230;

<br>

39. **Remark: we say that we execute a given policy π if given a state a we take the action a=π(s).**

&#10230;

<br>

40. **Value function ― For a given policy π and a given state s, we define the value function Vπ as follows:**

&#10230;

<br>

41. **Bellman equation ― The optimal Bellman equations characterizes the value function Vπ∗ of the optimal policy π∗:**

&#10230;

<br>

42. **Remark: we note that the optimal policy π∗ for a given state s is such that:**

&#10230;

<br>

43. **Value iteration algorithm ― The value iteration algorithm is in two steps:**

&#10230;

<br>

44. **1) We initialize the value:**

&#10230;

<br>

45. **2) We iterate the value based on the values before:**

&#10230;

<br>

46. **Maximum likelihood estimate ― The maximum likelihood estimates for the state transition probabilities are as follows:**

&#10230;

<br>

47. **times took action a in state s and got to s′**

&#10230;

<br>

48. **times took action a in state s**
